# maintenance_fee

In May 2024, I used linear regression to forecast my future monthly maintenance fees through the year 2081. I moved into my coop in 2019, and at the time my monthly maintenance fee was $550.35. It increases 1% every year. I was particularly curious to see how much the fee would be my first year of retirement in the year 2047 until I turn 99 in the year 2081. 

It turns out that in 2047, assuming that there are no changes in how much the percentage increases, the fee will be $696.07. By the year 2081, itâ€™ll be $875.24.
